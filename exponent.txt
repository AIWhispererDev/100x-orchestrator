100x-orchestrator: AI Agent Orchestration System

Overview:
A sophisticated orchestration system that manages multiple AI coding agents working on software development tasks. The system uses Aider (an AI coding assistant) to handle coding tasks and provides a web interface for monitoring and managing these agents.

Key Components:

1. Orchestrator (orchestrator.py)
- Manages multiple AI coding agents
- Handles workspace creation and git repository cloning
- Monitors agent progress and provides critiques
- Maintains agent sessions and outputs
- Uses Aider for code generation and modifications

2. Configuration Manager (config.py)
- Handles system configuration
- Manages repository URLs
- Tracks tasks and their status
- Controls agent count per task
- Persists configuration in JSON format

3. Web Interface (app.py)
- Flask-based web application
- Provides agent creation and management
- Displays agent status and progress
- Allows task assignment and monitoring
- Supports agent deletion and cleanup

Key Features:
- Multi-agent task handling
- Git integration
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Workspace isolation
- Configuration management
- Web-based control interface
- Automated code critiquing
- Session management

Technical Stack:
- Python
- Flask
- Aider
- Git
- JSON for configuration
- Threading for concurrent operations
